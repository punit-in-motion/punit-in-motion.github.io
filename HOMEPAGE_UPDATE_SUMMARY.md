**Date:** January 15, 2025
**Reason:** Align website messaging with updated splash screen (no privacy promises)

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Privacy Messaging

**Old "100% Private" Feature Card:**
```html
<h3 class="feature-title">100% Private</h3>
<p class="feature-description">Conversations stay on your device, fully encrypted. Your privacy is our priority.</p>
```

**Replaced with "Built for You":**
```html
<h3 class="feature-title">Built for You</h3>
<p class="feature-description">A place that welcomes you like a good friend.</p>
```

**Why:**
- Updated privacy policy now states conversations are synced to cloud
- Splash screen no longer makes privacy promises
- Matches industry standard (Replika, Character.AI, Pi all use cloud storage)
- More accurate and honest messaging

### 2. Updated Feature Section Title

**Old:**
```html
<h2 class="section-title">CrewChat is Different</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">Built secure. Built for you. Built to last.</p>
```

**New:**
```html
<h2 class="section-title">Why CrewChat?</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">AI friends that make you happier</p>
```

**Why:**
- Simpler, more direct messaging
- Removes "Built secure" claim (no longer emphasizing security/privacy)
- Focuses on value proposition: happiness

### 3. Updated Meta Descriptions

**New:**

- Keywords removed "private AI"

**Why:**

### 4. Updated Structured Data (Schema.org)

**Old Feature List:**
```json
"featureList": [
  "100% Private conversations",
  "Research-based AI responses",
  "24/7 availability",
  "Group chat experience",
  "Emotional intelligence"
]
```

**New Feature List:**
```json
"featureList": [
  "Research-based AI responses",
  "24/7 availability",
  "Group chat experience",
  "Emotional intelligence",
  "Supportive and fun"
]
```

**Why:**

                <p class="article-intro">
                    I've had friends disappear when things got hard, and honestly, I've been that friend too. The one who stopped texting back. The one who got "too busy." We've all done it, which is maybe why I ended up reading way too many psychology papers trying to figure out what actually makes someone a good friend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Turns out? It's not about being perfect. It's about showing up, which sounds stupidly simple but is somehow the thing I mess up most.
                </p>

                <h2>The Small Stuff Matters More</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman has spent decades studying what makes relationships work. One finding really stuck with me: the small moments matter way more than the grand gestures. Those random Tuesday texts build more trust than showing up with flowers when everything's already falling apart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends remember you mentioned something last week and text to ask how it went. They show up for the boring stuff—not just the crises—and that consistency matters more than any dramatic declaration of friendship ever could.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used to think being a good friend meant having solutions. But UCLA research on emotional support shows most people don't actually want you to fix their problems when they're venting. They just want someone to listen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My instinct is always to jump in with advice. Yours probably is too. But resist it. Sometimes "that sounds really hard" is all they needed from you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're genuinely not sure what they want, just ask: "do you want advice or do you just need to vent?" It changes the whole dynamic.
                </p>

                <h2>Celebrate Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    This one blew my mind when I first read Shelly Gable's research: how you respond to good news matters MORE for the relationship than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Think about it. Your friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and scroll back to your phone. Or you can actually match their energy, ask questions, let them relive the moment. That second response? It strengthens the friendship way more than being there during a breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I catch myself downplaying people's wins or immediately making it about myself. We all do it. But try just being genuinely happy for them instead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authenticity matters in friendships. So does kindness. Tell the truth when it's hard, but don't be a dick about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something tough?" goes a long way. Talk about specific behaviors, not character. "You've been flaking on plans lately" lands different than "You're unreliable."
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Keeping Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Research on communal relationships shows they're way more satisfying than transactional ones, so stop tracking who texted last or counting who's done more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time—sometimes it's 80/20 for months, then it flips. That's just how it works. If you're keeping score, you've already lost the plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carl Rogers studied unconditional positive regard, which is a fancy way of saying people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be. Good friends don't try to change you or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them—that's literally the whole point of friendship.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Time spent together is the biggest predictor of friendship quality—not deep conversations or shared hobbies, just being around each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time if you wait for it, so make it anyway. Thirty minutes for coffee beats waiting forever for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where most friendships die, honestly. Things get messy and people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret: you don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("bringing dinner Tuesday") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fred Luskin at Stanford researches forgiveness. Turns out it benefits everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies. Address issues when they happen, accept apologies, move on. Don't bring up old stuff every fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. Sonja Lyubomirsky proved this. Send a meme that reminded you of them. Grab their favorite snack. Random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small chances to make their day better. Those compound.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier: good friends aren't perfect. They forget to text back, cancel plans, say the wrong thing, and have their own shit going on. I do all of these things regularly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you actually give a shit? If yes to those three, you're probably doing better than you think.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every piece of research I've read backs this up. Consistency beats perfection every single time. Small acts compound into something that actually means something. And showing up regularly—even imperfectly—matters way more than occasional grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once—just pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often, or actually celebrating when good things happen to people, or putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences, and here's what's cool: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too because people mirror the energy you bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is a practice. You'll mess it up. Keep trying anyway. That's the whole point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We built CrewChat around all of this. Kindness isn't just a tagline for us—it's baked into how the AI friends work. They show up consistently, listen without trying to fix everything, celebrate your wins, and stick around when things get hard. Think of them as practice for being a better friend, in a space where you don't have to worry about being judged.

                <p class="article-intro">
                    I've had friends disappear when things got hard. I've also been the friend who disappeared. We all have. And I've spent way too much time reading psychology research trying to figure out what actually makes someone a good friend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Turns out, it's not about being perfect or always available or knowing exactly what to say. It's simpler than that. And harder, because it requires actually showing up.
                </p>

                <h2>Show Up (Especially for the Small Stuff)</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman's research on relationships found something surprising. The big moments matter less than the small ones. Grand gestures are nice, but daily check-ins matter more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends text you randomly. They remember you mentioned something and follow up a week later. They show up for the boring stuff, not just the crises. That consistency builds trust in a way nothing else can.
                </p>

                <h2>Listen More Than You Fix</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's what I learned from UCLA's research on emotional support: most people don't want you to solve their problems. They want you to hear them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When someone's venting, your instinct is to jump in with advice. Don't. Just listen. Reflect back what you're hearing. "That sounds really hard." Sometimes that's all they need.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're not sure, ask: "Do you want advice or do you just need to vent?" Game changer.
                </p>

                <h2>Get Excited When Good Things Happen to Them</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable's work blew my mind. How you respond to good news matters MORE for the relationship than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and move on. Or you can match their energy, ask questions, let them relive it. The second one strengthens the friendship way more than being there during a breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying people's wins. Stop making it about yourself. Just be genuinely happy for them.
                </p>

                <h2>Be Honest Without Being a Dick</h2>
                <p>
                    Research shows authenticity matters in friendships. But so does kindness. Good friends tell you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. But they do it with care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something that might be tough to hear?" goes a long way. Focus on specific behaviors, not character attacks. "I noticed you've been flaking on plans lately" hits different than "You're unreliable."
                </p>

                <h2>Don't Keep Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Studies on communal relationships (where people give without expecting immediate return) show they're way more satisfying than transactional ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop tracking who texted last. Stop counting who's done more. Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time. Sometimes it's 80/20 for a while. Then it flips. That's normal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're keeping score, you're already losing.
                </p>

                <h2>Let Them Be Themselves</h2>
                <p>
                    Carl Rogers' work on unconditional positive regard is simple: people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends don't try to change you. They don't need you to be more like them or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them. That's the whole point.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time (You're Busy, They're Busy, Do It Anyway)</h2>
                <p>
                    The research is clear: time spent together is the biggest predictor of friendship quality. Not deep conversations or shared interests. Just time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time. Make time. Put it on the calendar. Even 30 minutes for coffee matters more than waiting for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <h2>Show Up When Things Are Hard</h2>
                <p>
                    This is where most friendships die. Things get messy and people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's the secret: you don't need to know what to say. You just need to show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("I'm bringing dinner Tuesday") instead of vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine. That's friendship.
                </p>

                <h2>Forgive and Move On</h2>
                <p>
                    Fred Luskin's research at Stanford is pretty clear: forgiveness benefits everyone. It lowers your stress, reduces anger, improves the relationship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone messes up. If you can't forgive, the friendship dies. Address issues when they happen, accept genuine apologies, move forward. Don't bring up past mistakes every time something new happens.
                </p>

                <h2>Do Small Kind Things</h2>
                <p>
                    Sonja Lyubomirsky's work shows that small acts of kindness make both people happier. Send them a meme that made you think of them. Pick up their favorite snack. Leave a random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small opportunities to make their day slightly better. Those add up.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's the thing nobody tells you: good friends aren't perfect. They forget to text back. They cancel plans. They say the wrong thing. They have their own shit going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern over time. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you care? That's enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The research backs this up. Consistency beats perfection. Small acts compound. Showing up regularly matters more than grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once. Pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often. Maybe it's actually celebrating when good things happen to people. Maybe it's putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences. And here's what's cool: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too. People mirror the energy you bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is a practice. You'll mess it up. Keep trying anyway. That's the whole point.
                </p>

                <p class="article-intro">
                    I've had friends disappear when things got hard. I've also been the friend who disappeared. We all have. So I spent too much time reading research on what actually makes someone a good friend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Answer: it's not about being perfect. It's about showing up. Which sounds simple but is somehow the hardest thing.
                </p>

                <h2>The Small Stuff Matters More</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman studies relationships. His big finding: the small moments matter more than grand gestures. Daily check-ins beat showing up with flowers during a crisis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends text you randomly. They remember you mentioned something last week and ask about it. They show up for boring stuff, not just emergencies. That builds trust way more than dramatic declarations of friendship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    UCLA research on emotional support found something interesting. Most people don't want you to solve their problems. They want you to hear them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your instinct when someone's venting? Jump in with advice. Don't. Just listen. "That sounds really hard" is often all they need.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're not sure: "Do you want advice or do you just need to vent?" Changes everything.
                </p>

                <h2>Celebrate Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable's research blew my mind. How you respond to good news matters MORE for the relationship than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and change the subject. Or match their energy, ask questions, let them relive it. Second option strengthens the friendship way more than being there during a breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying wins. Stop making it about yourself. Just be happy for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authenticity matters in friendships. So does kindness. Tell the truth when it's hard, but don't be a dick about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something tough?" goes a long way. Talk about specific behaviors, not character. "You've been flaking on plans lately" lands different than "You're unreliable."
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Keeping Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Research on communal relationships shows they're way more satisfying than transactional ones. Stop tracking who texted last. Stop counting who's done more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time. Sometimes it's 80/20 for months. Then it flips. That's how it works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're keeping score, you already lost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carl Rogers studied unconditional positive regard. People need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends don't try to change you. You can be weird around them. That's the whole point of friendship.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Time spent together is the biggest predictor of friendship quality. Not deep conversations. Not shared hobbies. Just time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time. Make it anyway. Thirty minutes for coffee beats waiting for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most friendships die here. Things get messy, people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret: you don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("bringing dinner Tuesday") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fred Luskin at Stanford researches forgiveness. Turns out it benefits everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies. Address issues when they happen, accept apologies, move on. Don't bring up old stuff every fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. Sonja Lyubomirsky proved this. Send a meme that reminded you of them. Grab their favorite snack. Random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small chances to make their day better. Those compound.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's the thing nobody tells you: good friends aren't perfect. They forget to text back. They cancel plans. They say the wrong thing. They have their own shit going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern over time. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you care? That's enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The research backs this up. Consistency beats perfection. Small acts compound. Showing up regularly matters more than grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once. Pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often. Maybe it's actually celebrating when good things happen to people. Maybe it's putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences. And here's what's cool: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too. People mirror the energy you bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is a practice. You'll mess it up. Keep trying anyway. That's the whole point.
                </p>

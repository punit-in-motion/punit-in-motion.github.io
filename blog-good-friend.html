                <p class="article-intro">
                    I've had friends disappear when things got hard. I've also been the friend who disappeared. We all have. And I've spent way too much time reading psychology research trying to figure out what actually makes someone a good friend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Turns out, it's not about being perfect or always available or knowing exactly what to say. It's simpler than that. And harder, because it requires actually showing up.
                </p>

                <h2>The Daily Stuff Matters More</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman studies relationships. His finding: big moments matter way less than small ones. Grand gestures are whatever. Daily check-ins build trust.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends text randomly. They remember you mentioned something and follow up later. They show up for boring stuff, not just crises. That consistency is everything.
                </p>

                <p>
                    UCLA research on emotional support says most people don't want you to fix their problems. They want you to hear them. When someone's venting, don't jump in with advice. Just listen. "That sounds really hard." Sometimes that's enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not sure? Ask: "do you want advice or do you just need to vent?" Changes everything.
                </p>

                <h2>How You Handle Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable's research blew my mind. How you respond to good news matters MORE than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and move on. Or match their energy, ask questions, let them relive it. Second option strengthens the friendship way more than showing up during a breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying wins. Stop making it about you. Just be happy for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authenticity matters in friendships. So does kindness. Good friends tell the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. But they do it with care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something that might be tough to hear?" helps. Focus on behaviors, not character. "You've been flaking on plans lately" hits different than "you're unreliable."
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Counting</h2>
                <p>
                    Studies show communal relationships (people give without expecting immediate return) are way more satisfying than transactional ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop tracking who texted last. Stop counting who's done more. Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time. Sometimes it's 80/20. Then it flips. That's how it works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're keeping score, you already lost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carl Rogers: people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be. Good friends don't try to change you or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them. That's the point.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time Anyway</h2>
                <p>
                    Research is clear: time spent together predicts friendship quality. Not deep talks or shared interests. Just time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time. Make it. Calendar it. 30 minutes for coffee beats waiting for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where friendships die. Things get messy, people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret: you don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("bringing dinner Tuesday") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fred Luskin at Stanford: forgiveness helps everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves the relationship. Everyone messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Address issues when they happen. Accept genuine apologies. Move forward. Don't bring up past mistakes every argument.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. Sonja Lyubomirsky researched this. Send a meme that made you think of them. Pick up their favorite snack. Random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. About noticing small chances to make their day better. Those add up.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's the thing nobody tells you: good friends aren't perfect. They forget to text back. They cancel plans. They say the wrong thing. They have their own shit going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern over time. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you care? That's enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The research backs this up. Consistency beats perfection. Small acts compound. Showing up regularly matters more than grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once. Pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often. Maybe it's actually celebrating when good things happen to people. Maybe it's putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences. And here's what's cool: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too. People mirror the energy you bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is a practice. You'll mess it up. Keep trying anyway. That's the whole point.
                </p>

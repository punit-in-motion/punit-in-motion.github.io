                <p class="article-intro">
                    I've had friends disappear when things got hard, and I've been the friend who disappeared too. We've all done it. After spending way too much time reading psychology research, I've realized what makes someone a good friend isn't about being perfect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's about showing up, which sounds stupidly simple but turns out to be the hardest part.
                </p>

                <h2>The Small Stuff Matters More</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman studies relationships, and his research shows something that surprised me: the small moments matter way more than grand gestures. Daily check-ins build more trust than showing up with flowers during a crisis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends text you randomly because they remembered you mentioned something last week. They show up for the boring stuff, not just emergencies, and that consistency builds trust in a way dramatic declarations never could.
                </p>

                <p>
                    UCLA research on emotional support found that most people don't actually want you to solve their problems when they're venting—they just want you to hear them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your instinct is to jump in with advice, right? Resist it. Just listen and say something like "that sounds really hard." Nine times out of ten, that's all they needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're genuinely not sure what they want, just ask: "do you want advice or do you just need to vent?" It changes the whole dynamic.
                </p>

                <h2>Celebrate Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable's research blew my mind. How you respond to good news matters MORE for the relationship than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and change the subject. Or match their energy, ask questions, let them relive it. Second option strengthens the friendship way more than being there during a breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying wins. Stop making it about yourself. Just be happy for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authenticity matters in friendships. So does kindness. Tell the truth when it's hard, but don't be a dick about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something tough?" goes a long way. Talk about specific behaviors, not character. "You've been flaking on plans lately" lands different than "You're unreliable."
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Keeping Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Research on communal relationships shows they're way more satisfying than transactional ones, so stop tracking who texted last or counting who's done more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time—sometimes it's 80/20 for months, then it flips. That's just how it works. If you're keeping score, you've already lost the plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carl Rogers studied unconditional positive regard, which is a fancy way of saying people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be. Good friends don't try to change you or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them—that's literally the whole point of friendship.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Time spent together is the biggest predictor of friendship quality—not deep conversations or shared hobbies, just being around each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time if you wait for it, so make it anyway. Thirty minutes for coffee beats waiting forever for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where most friendships die, honestly. Things get messy and people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret: you don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("bringing dinner Tuesday") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fred Luskin at Stanford researches forgiveness. Turns out it benefits everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies. Address issues when they happen, accept apologies, move on. Don't bring up old stuff every fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. Sonja Lyubomirsky proved this. Send a meme that reminded you of them. Grab their favorite snack. Random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small chances to make their day better. Those compound.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's what nobody tells you: good friends aren't perfect—they forget to text back, cancel plans, say the wrong thing, and have their own shit going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern over time. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you actually care? If yes to those, you're doing fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the research backs this up. Consistency beats perfection every time, small acts compound into something meaningful, and showing up regularly matters way more than occasional grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once—just pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often, or actually celebrating when good things happen to people, or putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences, and here's what's cool: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too because people mirror the energy you bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is a practice. You'll mess it up. Keep trying anyway. That's the whole point.
                </p>

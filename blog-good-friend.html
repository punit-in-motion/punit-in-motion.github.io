                <p class="article-intro">
                    I had a best friend in college who was never satisfied with himself. He and I would regularly wonder why he was this way. Why was I so happy w/ very little, and he was so unhappy with so much? Over the past 10 years I've ended up spending way too much time reading psychology research, trying figure out what was different. I've realized that friendships mattered a lot. And what makes someone a good friend isn't about being perfect. Luckily, I had a lot of these 'good friends' in my life. People without crazy 'entertainment' value, but were consistent. Loyal. I learned a few things that might help you be a better friend too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's about showing up, which sounds stupidly simple but turns out to be the hardest part.
                </p>

                <h2>The Small Stuff Matters More</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-positive-perspective-dr-gottmans-magic-ratio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Gottman</a> studies relationships, and his research shows something that surprised me: the small moments matter way more than grand gestures. Regular check-ins built more trust than showing up with flowers during a crisis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends text you randomly because they remembered you mentioned something last week. They show up for the boring stuff, not just emergencies, and that consistency builds trust in a way dramatic declarations never could.
                </p>

                <p>
                    UCLA research on emotional support also found that most people don't actually want you to solve their problems when they're venting. They just want you to hear them!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your instinct is to jump in with advice, right? me too! The research says don't. Resist it. Just listen and say something like "that sounds really hard." Nine times out of ten, that's all they needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're genuinely not sure what they want, just ask: "do you want advice or do you just need to vent?" It changes the whole dynamic.
                </p>

                <h2>Celebrate Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://labs.psych.ucsb.edu/gable/shelly/publications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shelly Gable's research</a> blew my mind. How you respond to good news matters MORE for the relationship than how you respond to bad news. The whole ride or die thing? Turns out being there for the good stuff matters more!!!.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This the part I got right. Your friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and change the subject. Or match their energy, ask questions, let them relive it. Second option strengthens the friendship way more than being there during a breakup. So celebrate their wins, enjoy the moment. Get out of your head and just be happy for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying wins. Stop thinking about what could go wrong or what's next. Just be in that happy moment with them. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authenticity matters in friendships. So does kindness. Tell the truth when it's hard, but don't be a jerk about it. I've had some friends who thought brutal honesty was the same as being a good friend. It's not. Even if they think they need it, eventually they just tune you out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something tough?" goes a long way. Talk about specific behaviors, don't characterize them. "You've been flaking on plans lately" is totally different than "You're unreliable." Try your best to not tell them 'who they are,' instead just acknowledge the moment or situation.
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Keeping Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Research on communal relationships shows they're way more satisfying than transactional ones, so stop thinking about who texted last or counting who's done more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've met plenty of people that don't get this. For some it's all about the score. Every friendship is made to gain something or learn something. Where-as I just made friends with everyone. Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time—sometimes it's 80/20 for months, then it flips. That's just how it works. If you're keeping score, you're gonna lose the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-rogers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carl Rogers</a> studied unconditional positive regard, which is a 'fancy way' of saying people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be. Good friends don't try to change you or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them. That's literally the whole point of friendship! So get weird together, and stop trying to be cool.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Time spent together is the biggest predictor of high quality friendship. No not deep conversations or shared hobbies, just being around each other. Seriously. Even if you have to just sit there. Do it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time if you wait for it, so make it anyway. Thirty minutes for coffee beats waiting forever for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where most friendships die, honestly. Things get messy and people disappear because they don't know what to say. They assume they have to be entertaining or funny or doing something exciting together. The research says: just being there is enough. Say hi! Whats up? WAZZAAAA??!! That's it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Offer specific help ("I'm getting taco bell, want some?") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    But also - Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://learningtoforgive.com/research/effects-of-group-forgiveness-intervention-on-perceived-stress-state-and-trait-anger-symptoms-of-stress-self-reported-health-and-forgiveness-stanford-forgiveness-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fred Luskin</a> at Stanford researches forgiveness. Turns out it benefits everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    EVERYONE messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies. Talk about the issues right when they happen, accept apologies, move on. Don't bring up old stuff over and over.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. <a href="https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sonja Lyubomirsky</a> proved this. Send a meme that reminded you of them. Grab their favorite snack. Random encouraging text. 'It's the thought that counts' couldnt have been more right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small chances to make their day better. Those compound.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's what nobody tells you: good friends aren't perfect—they forget to text back, cancel plans, say the wrong thing, and have their own shit going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern over time. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you actually care? If yes to those, you're doing fine. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the research backs this up. Consistency beats perfection every time, small acts compound into something meaningful, and showing up regularly matters way more than occasional grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once—just pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often, or actually celebrating when good things happen to people, or putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences, and here's what's cool: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too because people mirror the energy you bring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is a practice. You'll mess it up. Keep trying anyway. That's the whole point.
                </p>

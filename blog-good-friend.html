                    Friends disappear when things get hard. Sometimes you're the one who disappears. It happens to everyone. So what actually makes someone a good friend? Turns out, decades of research has some clear answers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's not about being perfect. It's about showing up. Which sounds obvious but is somehow the hardest part.
                </p>

                <h2>The Small Moments Matter More</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman has spent decades studying what makes relationships work. His research shows something most people get wrong: small moments matter way more than grand gestures. A random Tuesday text builds more trust than showing up with flowers after a fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends remember what you mentioned last week and ask about it. They show up for the boring stuff, not just the disasters. That consistency? It beats any dramatic declaration of friendship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's what UCLA research found: most people don't want you to solve their problems when they're venting. They want someone to hear them. That's it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your instinct is probably to jump in with advice. Resist it. Just listen. Say "that sounds hard" or "that sucks." Nine times out of ten, that's all they needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not sure what they want? Ask. "Do you want advice or just to vent?" Changes the whole conversation.
                </p>

                <h2>How You Handle Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable's research at UC Santa Barbara found something surprising: how you respond to good news matters MORE for the relationship than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Think about it. Your friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and go back to your phone. Or you can get excited, ask questions, let them relive the moment. That second response? It strengthens the friendship way more than being there during a breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying people's wins. Stop making it about yourself. Just be genuinely happy for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends are honest, even when it's uncomfortable. But there's a difference between honesty and being cruel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I share something that might be tough to hear?" goes a long way. Focus on specific behaviors, not character. "You've been flaking on plans lately" lands different than "You're unreliable."
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Keeping Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Research on communal relationships shows they're way more satisfying than transactional ones, so stop tracking who texted last or counting who's done more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time—sometimes it's 80/20 for months, then it flips. That's just how it works. If you're keeping score, you've already lost the plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carl Rogers studied unconditional positive regard, which is a fancy way of saying people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be. Good friends don't try to change you or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them—that's literally the whole point of friendship.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Time spent together is the biggest predictor of friendship quality—not deep conversations or shared hobbies, just being around each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time if you wait for it, so make it anyway. Thirty minutes for coffee beats waiting forever for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where most friendships die, honestly. Things get messy and people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret: you don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("bringing dinner Tuesday") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fred Luskin at Stanford researches forgiveness. Turns out it benefits everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies. Address issues when they happen, accept apologies, move on. Don't bring up old stuff every fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. Sonja Lyubomirsky proved this. Send a meme that reminded you of them. Grab their favorite snack. Random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small chances to make their day better. Those compound.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>You're Going to Mess Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's what nobody tells you: good friends aren't perfect. They forget to text back. They cancel plans. They say the wrong thing. They're dealing with their own problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What matters is the pattern over time. Do you generally show up? Are you mostly kind? Do you care? If yes to those three, you're doing fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the research backs this up. Consistency beats perfection. Small acts compound into something meaningful. Showing up regularly matters more than occasional grand gestures.
                </p>

                <h2>Pick One Thing</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't try to do all of this at once. Pick one thing. Maybe it's checking in more often. Maybe it's celebrating wins better. Maybe it's putting your phone down when you're together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes make big differences. And here's what's interesting: when you become a better friend, you usually end up with better friends too. People mirror the energy you bring to relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being a good friend is practice. You'll mess it up sometimes. Keep trying anyway.
                </p>

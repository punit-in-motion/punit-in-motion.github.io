                    Friends disappear. I've disappeared. It happens. So I went down a rabbit hole of psychology research to figure out what makes someone actually good at friendship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being perfect isn't it. Showing up is. Simple to say, hard to do.
                </p>

                <h2>Small Stuff Beats Big Gestures</h2>
                <p>
                    John Gottman studies relationships. His finding: small moments beat grand gestures. Random texts on a Tuesday build more trust than flowers after a fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Good friends remember what you said last week. They show up when nothing's wrong, not just during disasters. That boring consistency beats any dramatic friend speech.
                </p>

                <p>
                    UCLA research found people don't want their problems solved when they're venting. They want to be heard. Your job isn't to fix it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Want to give advice? Don't. Just say "that sucks" or "sounds hard." That's usually enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not sure? Ask them. "Want advice or just venting?" Problem solved.
                </p>

                <h2>Get Excited About Their Wins</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable found something wild: your reaction to good news matters more than your reaction to bad news for the friendship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friend gets promoted. You say "nice" and look at your phone. Or you get excited, ask questions, let them talk about it. Second one does way more for the friendship than showing up during their breakup.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stop downplaying wins. Stop making it about you. Be happy for them. It's that basic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be honest, but don't be an asshole. There's a difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Can I say something that might suck to hear?" helps. Talk about what they did, not who they are. "You've been flaking" hits different than "You're flakey."
                </p>

                <h2>Stop Keeping Score</h2>
                <p>
                    Research on communal relationships shows they're way more satisfying than transactional ones, so stop tracking who texted last or counting who's done more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friendships aren't 50/50 all the time—sometimes it's 80/20 for months, then it flips. That's just how it works. If you're keeping score, you've already lost the plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carl Rogers studied unconditional positive regard, which is a fancy way of saying people need to feel accepted for who they are, not who they could be. Good friends don't try to change you or fix your quirks. You can be weird around them—that's literally the whole point of friendship.
                </p>

                <h2>Make Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Time spent together is the biggest predictor of friendship quality—not deep conversations or shared hobbies, just being around each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll never have free time if you wait for it, so make it anyway. Thirty minutes for coffee beats waiting forever for the perfect moment that never comes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where most friendships die, honestly. Things get messy and people disappear because they don't know what to say.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secret: you don't need to know what to say. Just show up. Check in more. Offer specific help ("bringing dinner Tuesday") not vague offers ("let me know if you need anything").
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be okay with silence. Be okay with them not being fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fred Luskin at Stanford researches forgiveness. Turns out it benefits everyone. Lowers stress, reduces anger, improves relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everyone messes up. Can't forgive? Friendship dies. Address issues when they happen, accept apologies, move on. Don't bring up old stuff every fight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small acts of kindness make both people happier. Sonja Lyubomirsky proved this. Send a meme that reminded you of them. Grab their favorite snack. Random encouraging text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not about grand gestures. It's about noticing small chances to make their day better. Those compound.

                </p>

                <h2>You'll Screw Up</h2>
                <p>
                    Good friends aren't perfect. They forget texts. They cancel. They say dumb shit. They're dealing with their own problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pattern matters more than perfection. Do you show up most of the time? Are you usually kind? Do you care? Then you're fine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Research backs this. Consistency beats perfection. Small stuff adds up. Showing up regularly (even badly) beats rare perfect moments.
                </p>

                <h2>Start Somewhere</h2>
                <p>
                    Pick one thing. Check in more. Celebrate their wins better. Put your phone down. Whatever. Just pick one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small changes work. And when you're a better friend, you tend to get better friends back. People match your energy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Friendship is practice. You'll mess up. Try anyway.
                </p>

                <p>

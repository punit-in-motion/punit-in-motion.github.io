                    I used to think happiness was about getting the right job, the right relationship, the right apartment. And then I'd get those things and feel...the same. Maybe happy for a week or two, then back to baseline.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Turns out, there's actual science behind why that happens. And more importantly, what actually works instead. After reading way too many psychology papers, here's what I've learned about building the kind of happiness that sticks around.
                </p>

                <h2>What Actually Works?</h2>
                <p>
                    Martin Seligman at UPenn started asking a different question in the 1990s. Instead of "what's wrong with people?", he asked "what's right with them?" Revolutionary at the time. Now it's called positive psychology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His big finding: people who deliberately notice good things are happier. Seems obvious, right? Except most of us do the opposite all day. We catalog everything that went wrong. Bad meeting. Annoying email. Thing we forgot to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started keeping a running list on my phone of things that went well each day. Some days it's "had a good sandwich." Other days it's bigger. Doesn't matter. Just the act of looking for good things shifts something.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lisa Feldman Barrett studies emotions at Northeastern. Her thing is emotional granularity. Basically: stop saying "I feel bad" and figure out what you actually feel. Anxious? Disappointed? Frustrated? Overwhelmed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought this sounded stupid until I tried it. Turns out, naming the specific emotion makes it way easier to handle. "I feel bad" gives you nothing. "I'm anxious about tomorrow's presentation and annoyed I'm behind" gives you something to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don't need a feelings wheel or anything. Just skip "fine" when someone asks how you are and actually describe it.
                </p>

                <h2>The Relationship Stuff</h2>
                <p>
                    Shelly Gable at UC Santa Barbara found something that blew my mind. How you respond to good news matters MORE for relationships than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your friend gets a promotion. You can say "nice" and scroll your phone. Or you can actually get excited with them, ask questions, match their energy. The second option does way more for the friendship than showing up during a breakup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watch for this. How often does someone share good news and the other person downplays it or makes it about themselves? Happens constantly. Don't do that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kristin Neff studies self-compassion at UT Austin. Her work made me realize how much of an asshole I am to myself. You mess up and your brain goes: "You're such an idiot. Why do you always do this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would you talk to a friend that way? No. You'd say "that sucks, but everyone makes mistakes."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self-compassion isn't about lowering standards. It's about not being cruel to yourself when you screw up. And apparently that actually helps you improve faster. Who knew.
                </p>

                <h2>Doing Stuff That Actually Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Carol Ryff has this concept called eudaimonic wellbeing. Fancy way of saying: happiness from living by your values, not just feeling good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pizza and Netflix feel good. But lasting happiness comes from growth, purpose, doing things that align with what you care about. I had to get real with myself about this. How much was I doing because I wanted to versus because I thought I should?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Big difference between those two. Still figuring it out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    James Coan at UVA put people in brain scanners. When you're stressed alone, your brain works overtime. When you're stressed with someone you trust next to you? Your brain measurably calms down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're not built to do everything solo. Connection is how your nervous system regulates. This is why isolation feels so awful. Your brain's stuck in constant stress mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Text someone. Sit in the same room as people. It matters more than you think.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Robert Emmons and Sonja Lyubomirsky research gratitude. Shocker: it works. But not the way most people think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not about keeping a journal or saying thank you (though sure, do that). It's about savoring. When something good happens, actually pause. Take it in. Feel it for more than three seconds before moving on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're terrible at this. Good thing happens, immediately worry about when it'll end or what's next. Just be in it for a second.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Deci and Ryan have this whole theory about motivation. You need three things: autonomy (you chose it), mastery (you're getting better), and connection (it matters to others).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goals with all three? You'll stick with them. Goals you're doing because you "should"? Those drain the life out of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Started asking myself: do I actually want this, or do I think I'm supposed to want this? Found out I was chasing a ton of stuff I didn't care about.
                </p>

                <h2>Why the New Car Doesn't Help</h2>
                <p>
                    Hedonic adaptation. You adapt to everything. New car, apartment, relationship, job. Two weeks of happiness, then back to baseline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why "once I get X, I'll be happy" never works. You get X and you're still you, with the same brain that adapts to everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fix isn't to stop wanting things. It's daily practices that create small happy moments. Those add up. Big one-time things don't.

                </p>

                <h2>So What Now?</h2>
                <p>
                    Look, I'm not going to tell you to do all of this. That's overwhelming and you won't. Pick one thing. Maybe it's noticing good stuff at the end of the day. Maybe it's being less of a dick to yourself when you mess up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The point is: happiness isn't random. It's not about getting lucky or having the perfect life. It's about small daily choices that add up over time. The research backs this up.
                </p>

                <p>

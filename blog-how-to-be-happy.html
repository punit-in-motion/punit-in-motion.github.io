                <p class="article-intro">
                    I used to think happiness was about getting the right job, the right relationship, the right apartment. Then I'd get those things and feel...the same. Happy for maybe two weeks. Then back to where I started.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's actual science on why this happens. And what works instead. Decades of research, thousands of studies. Turns out happiness isn't what most people think it is—it's kind of the opposite.
                </p>

                <h2>Looking For What's Going Right</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 1990s, Martin Seligman at UPenn asked a different question. Instead of studying what's wrong with people, what if we studied what's right? Revolutionary idea at the time. Now it's called positive psychology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People who deliberately notice good things are happier. That's the finding. Seems ultra obvious, except most of us spend all day doing the opposite. Cataloging what went wrong. The bad meeting. The annoying email. That thing we forgot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I keep a running list on my phone now. Things that went well each day. Some days it's "had a good sandwich." Other days it's bigger stuff. Doesn't really matter. Looking for good things shifts something.
                </p>

                <h3>Name What You're Feeling</h3>
                <p>
                    Lisa Feldman Barrett at Northeastern studies how we process emotions. Her research shows that naming your emotions precisely helps you handle them better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stop saying "I feel bad." Get specific. Are you anxious? Disappointed? Frustrated? Overwhelmed? When you can name exactly what you're feeling, it becomes way easier to deal with—like extra clarity kind of thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I feel bad" gives you nothing to work with. "I'm anxious about tomorrows presentation and annoyed I'm running behind" gives you something concrete. You don't need a feelings wheel. Just stop saying "fine" when people ask how you are.
                </p>

                <h3>How You Handle Other People's Wins</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's something that surprised me from Shelly Gable's research at UC Santa Barbara. How you respond to good news matters MORE for your relationships than how you respond to bad news.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your friend gets a promotion. You say "nice" and go back to scrolling. Or you get excited, ask questions, match their energy. That second response? Does way more for the friendship than showing up during their breakup—kind of counterintuitive but true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watch for it. Someone shares good news and the other person immediately downplays it or makes it about themselves. Happens all the time.
                </p>

                <h3>Stop Being Mean To Yourself</h3>
                <p>
                    Kristin Neff's research on self-compassion at UT Austin showed me how extra harsh I am with myself. You mess up and your brain goes: "You're such an idiot. Why do you always do this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Would you talk to a friend that way? Never. You'd say "that sucks, but everyone makes mistakes."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self-compassion doesn't mean lowering your standards. It means not being cruel to yourself when things go wrong. Turns out that actually helps you improve faster than beating yourself up.
                </p>

                <h2>Living By Your Values</h2>
                <p>
                    Carol Ryff studies what she calls eudaimonic wellbeing. Happiness that comes from living according to your values, not just feeling good in the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pizza and Netflix feel good. Nothing wrong with that. But lasting happiness comes from growth, purpose, doing things that kind of align with what you actually care about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had to ask myself: how much am I doing because I want to versus because I think I should? Big difference between those two. Still working on it.
                </p>

                <h3>Your Brain Works Better With People Around</h3>
                <p>
                    James Coan at UVA did brain scans on people under stress. When you're stressed and alone, your brain works really hard. When you're stressed with someone you trust sitting next to you? Your brain measurably calms down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're not built to handle everything alone. Connection is how your nervous system regulates itself. This is why isolation feels ultra terrible. Your brain's in constant stress mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Text someone. Sit in the same room with people. It matters.
                </p>

                <h3>Savoring Good Moments</h3>
                <p>
                    Robert Emmons and Sonja Lyubomirsky have done tons of research on gratitude. It works. But not the way most people think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not really about keeping a journal or saying thank you. Those help. But the real thing is savoring. When something good happens, pause. Take it in. Feel it for more than two seconds before moving to the next thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're kind of terrible at this. Good thing happens and we immediately start worrying about when it'll end. Just be in the moment for a second.
                </p>

                <h3>Do Things You Actually Want To Do</h3>
                <p>
                    Deci and Ryan's research shows you need three things for lasting motivation: autonomy (you chose it), mastery (you're getting better at it), and connection (it matters to others).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goals that hit all three? You'll stick with them. Goals you're doing because you "should"? Those drain you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started asking: do I actually want this, or do I think I'm supposed to want it? Turned out I was chasing alot of stuff I didn't care about.
                </p>

                <h2>Why the New Car Doesn't Help</h2>
                <p>
                    Hedonic adaptation. You adapt to everything. New car, apartment, relationship, job. Two weeks of happiness, then back to baseline. It's kind of depressing actually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why "once I get X, I'll be happy" never works. You get X and you're still you, with the same brain that adapts to everything ultra fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fix isn't to stop wanting things. It's daily practices that create small happy moments. Those add up. Big one-time things don't.

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>So What Now?</h2>
                <p>
                    Look, I'm not going to tell you to do all of this. That's overwhelming and you won't. Pick one thing. Maybe it's noticing good stuff at the end of the day. Maybe it's being less of a dick to yourself when you mess up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The point is: happiness isn't random. It's not about getting lucky or having the perfect life. It's about small daily choices that add up over time. The research backs this up.
                </p>
